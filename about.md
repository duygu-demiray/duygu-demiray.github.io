<p> I am Duygu, a first year Ph.D. student at the UMass Department of Linguistics. I am interested in sentence processing, particularly in how structural information is used to maintain and recall information about linguistic elements. I completed my MA in UCSC Linguistics and my BA in Boğaziçi University's Linguistics department, where I worked with Matt Wagers and Pavel Logačev. I am currently advised by Brian Dillon.
