<par> 
  I am Duygu, a first year Ph.D. student at the UMass Department of Linguistics. I am interested in <b>sentence processing</b>, particularly   how structural information is used to maintain and recall information about linguistic elements.

  I completed my MA in UCSC Linguistics where I worked with Matt Wagers on the processing of wh-in-situ dependencies in Turkish. Before        that, I did my BA in Boğaziçi University Linguistics where I worked with Pavel Logačev on how uninformed responses bias experimental         results. I am currently advised by Brian Dillon.
